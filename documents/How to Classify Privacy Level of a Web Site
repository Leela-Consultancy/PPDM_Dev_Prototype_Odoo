How to classify websites into the three distinct categories showing the level of Privacy Policy:

Strict Privacy:

Key Indicators:
Explicit mention of GDPR, CCPA, or other significant privacy regulations and their compliance.
Detailed breakdown of each cookie's purpose.
No third-party tracking or advertising cookies without clear and explicit user consent.
Short cookie lifespans unless necessary for core functionality.
Easily accessible tools or settings for users to review and manage cookie preferences.
Methodology:
Automated keyword scanning: Use web scraping tools or APIs to fetch privacy policies and scan for keywords like "GDPR", "user consent", "manage cookies", etc.
Manual review: Randomly select a subset of websites to manually review their policies to validate and refine your criteria.

Moderate Privacy:

Key Indicators:
Mention of some privacy regulations, but without comprehensive details on compliance.
Lists the types of cookies used, but not necessarily each individual cookie's purpose.
Third-party cookies might be present, but there's some degree of user control or at least notification.
Cookie lifespans may be longer, with some persistent cookies.
Methodology:
Automated keyword scanning: Look for generic terms like "cookies", "third-party", "lifespan", but the absence of more specific terms linked with strict privacy.
Manual review: As with strict privacy, manually review a subset to ensure that the classification criteria are consistent.

Loose Privacy:

Key Indicators:
Lack of specific mentions of privacy regulations.
Vague descriptions of cookie usage without details.
No clear tools or options for users to control cookie preferences.
Long-lived or permanent cookies without clear justification.
Methodology:
Automated keyword scanning: Look for the absence of key privacy terms or the presence of vague language.
Manual review: Essential for this category, as the lack of clear details can sometimes lead to misclassification. Manually verify a subset to ensure sites genuinely have lax privacy stances.
